# CS Interview Question Generator - Jhacks 2018 @ UMD

A humurous computer science interview question generator that makes questions of all difficulties, from easy to challenging, to help people prep for interviews. This was done as a comical and fun submission for the JHacks Hackathon 2018 at The University Of Maryland
